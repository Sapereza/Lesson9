LESSON 9: HTML RESPONSIVE WEBSITES: This lesson demonstrates creating responsive web designs. A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.

INSTRUCTIONS: You are to create a professional looking 4-page PORTFOLIO WEBSITE as described below.

To get started, view this layout.
Next, review the HTML Responsive Web Design tutorials on w3schools.
Then continue as follows:

Your site will include Home, About Me, My Portfolio page and Contact Me pages.

The layout will be similar to the layout at the link above.
    Include a banner with an image of yourself engaged in a random activity.
    Include different banners on all other pages.

About Me: This page should contain your bio, resume and a professional looking photograph. Your photograph should be a rounded image. Review this tutorial: How TO - Rounded Image

My Portfolio page: This page should contain bullet lists (links) pointing to all classwork and assignments completed so far.

Contact us:
    Review the form examples in the attached Chapter 7 zip folder.
    Use table layout to create a contact form similar to this one.

Place a copyright symbol, your name, year and course in the footer.

Your website should not have blank areas, except they are intentional and part of your overall design. Too many blank areas make websites appear unfinished, so you should avoid them.

A good use of images and appropriate content is required.

Test your responsive web design here on any of the mobile devices.
